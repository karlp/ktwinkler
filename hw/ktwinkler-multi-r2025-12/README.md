Instead of trying to make the tiniest little thing stuffed into a battery case, when we already know that they have buttons on different sides and locations, so it would never be one size fits all anyway, let's make something a bit different.

Just make it as a controller board, with a couple of channels, so you can just plug in some strings chopped off cheap kits.  Also. let's play with two cpus, and some different motor controllers to see what's "best"

Try allll the things!


# To try
* different cheap motor chips
* smt screw mount shits.
* battery ... wots?
